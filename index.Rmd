Hi Everyone!![](images/IMG_0311.jpeg)

Welcome to my humble online abode. My name is Clara and I'm a first year M.S. student in the NREN department. I'll be studying wildlife corridors and connectivity across the state of New Hampshire, which is fancy jargon for I will be putting out cameras on roads and culverts and seeing what animals use them for travel.

I am originally from North Carolina and graduated from NC State in 2020 with a B.S. in Zoology and minors in Wildlife Science and Marine Science. After graduating, I spent several years traveling the Midwestern and Southeastern United States working seasonal wildlife stints, with highlights including tracking gray wolves in Minnesota and radio collaring coyotes and bobcats in Illinois. When I'm not doing wildlife work, I love running, hiking, playing soccer and drawing.
